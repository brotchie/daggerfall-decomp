| File | Size | SHA-1 | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DFInstall.zip` | 155,934,919 | `2190f4286712c85bf63269d666e021045a51a7e9` | |
| `DFCD/DAGGER/FALL.EXE` | 1,837,675 | `f249e30922ac16d689f21490eebe08b44c7cd063` | dated 1996-09-05, "TES: Daggerfall v1.0." |
| `DAGGER/DAG213.EXE` | 1,474,681 | `1832fdf2e171024ebf9b985a439ee07de353b0e0` | dated 1997-03-28, the 1.07.213 patcher |

First look, from `strings`:

- The CD's `FALL.EXE` embeds **CauseWay v3.17** and the runtime string
  "WATCOM C/C++32 Run-Time system … 1988-1994". A 1994 copyright year points at **Watcom 10.0**
  (10.5 says 1988-1995), the same family KKND-Decomp matches.
- `DAG213.EXE` is not a binary diff file but a DOS program: a CauseWay v3.32 executable (also
  Watcom, also "1988-1994") whose strings are mostly compressed. It says "This program will
  upgrade Daggerfall to version 1.07.213. You must run this patch from your Daggerfall
  subdirectory." It has to be run (or reimplemented) to get the 1.07.213 `FALL.EXE`.

## 2026-10-01: the 1.07.213 executable

`tools/patch_213.sh` runs the official `DAG213.EXE` patcher headless in DOSBox-X (Homebrew
`dosbox-x`) on a copy of the CD files, answering its prompts with `AUTOTYPE`. It produces:

| File | Size | SHA-1 |
|---|---|---|
| `orig/1.07.213/FALL.EXE` | 1,864,183 | `c49a2ceb677239af733d0e0127ac810ec859c0ac` |

This is the target (`config/fall.sha1`). Checks that it's the build UESP documents:

- 0x1B682A holds the item table: "Ruby", "Emerald", "Sapphire", 48-byte records.
- 0x1AA57C holds the debug-menu strings: "Get rumor", "Advance level", "Jump 1 month".
- Strings: "TES: Daggerfall v1.07.", **CauseWay v3.32** (the CD build had 3.17), the same Watcom
  runtime string dated 1988-1994.

The patch also updates 70-odd quest and text files in `ARENA2`, `SETUP.EXE` and `REPORT.EXE`,
and adds `FIXMAPS.EXE` and `FIXSAVE.EXE`. `DAGGER.EXE` is unchanged.

The game folder also ships `HMIDRV.386`, `HMIDET.386` and `HMIMDRV.386`: HMI's Sound Operating
System drivers, which tells us the licensed sound library to expect inside `FALL.EXE`.
